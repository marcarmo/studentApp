Json sample ![Logo][1]
==============

This sample deals with Json message payloads when sending and receiving messages to the todo sample
application. Read about this feature in [reference guide][4]

Objectives
---------

The [todo-list](../todo-app/README.md) sample application provides a REST API for managing todo entries.
We call this API and receive Json message structures for validation in our test cases.

We can use Json as message payloads directly in the test cases.
    
```xml
<http:send-request client="todoClient">
    <http:POST path="/api/todolist">
      <http:headers content-type="application/json"/>
      <http:body type="json">
        <http:data>
          <![CDATA[
            { "id": "${todoId}", "title": "${todoName}", "description": "${todoDescription}", "done": ${done}}
          ]]>
        </http:data>
      </http:body>
    </http:POST>
</http:send-request>
```
        
As you can see we are able to send the Json data as payload. You can add test variables in message payloads. In a receive 
action we are able to use an expected Json message payload. Citrus performs a Json object comparison where each element is checked to meet
the expected values.

```xml
<http:receive-response client="todoClient">
    <http:headers status="200"/>
    <http:body type="json">
      <http:data>
        <![CDATA[
          { "id": "${todoId}", "title": "${todoName}", "description": "${todoDescription}", "done": ${done}}
        ]]>
      </http:data>
    </http:body>
</http:receive-response>
```

The Json message payload can be difficult to read when used as String concatenation. Fortunately we can also use file resources as message
payloads.

```xml
<http:receive-response client="todoClient">
    <http:headers status="200"/>
    <http:body type="json">
      <http:resource file="templates/todo.json"/>
    </http:body>
</http:receive-response>    
```
        
An alternative approach would be to use JsonPath expressions when validating incoming Json messages.

```xml
<http:receive-response client="todoClient">
    <http:headers status="200"/>
    <http:body type="json">
      <http:validate>
        <http:json-path expression="$.id" value="${todoId}"/>
        <http:json-path expression="$.title" value="todo_${todoId}"/>
        <http:json-path expression="$.description" value="@endsWith('todo_${todoId}')@"/>
        <http:json-path expression="$.done" value="false"/>
      </http:validate>
    </http:body>
</http:receive-response>
```
        
Each expression is evaluated and checked for expected values. In case a JsonPath expression can not be evaluated or 
does not meet the expected value the test ends with failure.
                
Run
---------

**NOTE:** This test depends on the [todo-app](../todo-app/) WAR which must have been installed into your local maven repository using `mvn clean install` beforehand.

The sample application uses Maven as build tool. So you can compile, package and test the
sample with Maven.
 
     mvn clean verify -Dembedded
    
This executes the complete Maven build lifecycle. The embedded option automatically starts a Jetty web
container before the integration test phase. The todo-list system under test is automatically deployed in this phase.
After that the Citrus test cases are able to interact with the todo-list application in the integration test phase.

During the build you will see Citrus performing some integration tests.
After the tests are finished the embedded Jetty web container and the todo-list application are automatically stopped.

System under test
---------

The sample uses a small todo list application as system under test. The application is a web application
that you can deploy on any web container. You can find the todo-list sources [here](../todo-app). Up to now we have started an 
embedded Jetty web container with automatic deployments during the Maven build lifecycle. This approach is fantastic 
when running automated tests in a continuous build.
  
Unfortunately the Jetty server and the sample application automatically get stopped when the Maven build is finished. 
There may be times we want to test against a standalone todo-list application.  

You can start the sample todo list application in Jetty with this command.

     mvn jetty:run

This starts the Jetty web container and automatically deploys the todo list app. Point your browser to
 
    http://localhost:8080/todolist/

You will see the web UI of the todo list and add some new todo entries.

Now we are ready to execute some Citrus tests in a separate JVM.

Citrus test
---------

Once the sample application is deployed and running you can execute the Citrus test cases.
Open a separate command line terminal and navigate to the sample folder.

Execute all Citrus tests by calling

     mvn verify

You can also pick a single test by calling

     mvn verify -Dit.test=<testname>

You should see Citrus performing several tests with lots of debugging output in both terminals (sample application server
and Citrus test client). And of course green tests at the very end of the build.

Of course you can also start the Citrus tests from your favorite IDE.
Just start the Citrus test using the TestNG IDE integration in IntelliJ, Eclipse or Netbeans.
